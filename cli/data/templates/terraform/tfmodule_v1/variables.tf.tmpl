# 🚀 Terraform Module - Variable Definitions
#
# This file (`variables.tf`) is dedicated to defining the variables used by your Terraform module.
# Variables serve as parameters for a Terraform module, allowing users to input values that can
# change the module's behavior without altering the module's own source code.

# 📖 Best Practices for Defining Variables:
# 1. Clear Descriptions: Provide a clear, detailed description for each variable. This helps users
#    understand the purpose of the variable and how it affects the module's resources.
# 2. Sensible Defaults: Where appropriate, define sensible default values for variables. Defaults can
#    simplify module usage for common scenarios, making the module more accessible to beginners.
# 3. Type Constraints: Specify the type of each variable. This improves usability by catching
#    incorrect inputs early and clarifying the expected data type for users.
# 4. Use of EOF for Descriptions: For longer descriptions, use the "heredoc" syntax
#    to maintain readability, especially in scenarios where resources are conditionally included in larger, composite modules.

variable "is_enabled" {
type        = bool
description = <<-EOF
Whether this module will be created or not. It is useful for stack-composite
modules that conditionally include resources provided by this module.
EOF
}

# Variable: Resource Tags
# Description: A map of tags that will be applied to all resources created by this module.
# Tags are key-value pairs that can help you organize and categorize resources, especially
# for cost tracking, environment distinction (prod, dev, test), or ownership attribution.
variable "tags" {
type        = map(string)
description = "A map of tags to add to all resources created by this module."
default     = {}
}

# 💡 Tip: Consistently review and update your variables to ensure they remain relevant and
# comprehensive. This practice helps in keeping your module flexible and user-friendly.
