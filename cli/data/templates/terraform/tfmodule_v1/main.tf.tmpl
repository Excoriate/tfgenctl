# 🚀 Terraform Module - Main Configuration File
#
# This file (`main.tf`) serves as the heart of your Terraform module, defining the core
# resources and infrastructure components. As you develop your module, consider the following
# best practices to ensure maintainability, scalability, and readability.

# 🔍 General Best Practices:
# 1. Modularize: Break down your infrastructure into reusable modules to promote code reuse
#    and simplify maintenance.
# 2. Naming Conventions: Use clear, consistent naming conventions for resources and variables
#    to improve code readability and maintainability.
# 3. Resource Grouping: Group related resources logically using comments or separate files to
#    make your module easier to navigate.
# 4. Version Pinning: Pin to specific versions of Terraform and providers to ensure consistency
#    and prevent unexpected changes.
# 5. Documentation: Document your module's purpose, inputs, outputs, and usage examples to help
#    users understand and utilize your module effectively.

# 📦 Resource Configuration:
# Below is a placeholder resource configuration for a `random_string`. Replace it with your
# infrastructure components, following the Terraform documentation for each resource type.

resource "random_string" "random_text" {
# 'for_each' allows dynamic creation based on input variables. Modify 'local.is_enabled' as per your logic.
for_each = local.is_enabled

# 'length' determines the size of the string. Adjust it based on your security or usage requirements.
length = 10

# Set 'special' to false to exclude special characters. Change it according to your needs.
special = false
}
