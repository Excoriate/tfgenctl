# üöÄ Terraform Module - Local Values
#
# This file (`locals.tf`) is dedicated to defining local values within your Terraform module.
# Locals act as a simplification layer, allowing you to assign names to commonly used expressions
# or to compose more complex configurations in a readable manner.

# üìñ Best Practices for Using Locals:
# 1. Clarity: Use locals to improve the clarity of your Terraform code, making it easier to
#    understand and maintain.
# 2. Reusability: Define values that are reused throughout your module as locals to DRY
#    (Don't Repeat Yourself) your code and simplify updates.
# 3. Simplification: Use locals to simplify complex expressions, making your configurations
#    more readable and easier to debug.
# 4. Organization: Group related local values together for better organization and readability.

# Example Local Value: Module Enablement Flag
# Description: This local value acts as a simple flag to enable or disable the module's resources.
# It's derived from the `is_enabled` variable and can be used throughout the module to conditionally
# create resources.
locals {
is_enabled = var.is_enabled
}

# üí° Tip: Treat `locals` as a means to not only simplify and clarify your configurations but also
# as a mechanism to implement conditional logic and resource configurations in a clean and
# organized manner.

# Remember, well-organized and clearly documented Terraform code greatly enhances
# maintainability and collaboration within your team. Happy Terraforming! üåç‚ú®
