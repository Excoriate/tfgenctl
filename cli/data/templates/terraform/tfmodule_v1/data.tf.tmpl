# 🚀 Terraform Module - Data Sources
#
# This file (`data.tf`) is intended for defining data sources within your Terraform module.
# Data sources allow you to use information defined outside of Terraform, or defined by
# another separate Terraform configuration.

# 📖 Best Practices for Data Sources:
# 1. Reusability: Use data sources to fetch information that can be reused across multiple
#    resources or modules, enhancing modularity and DRY principles in your project.
# 2. Dynamic Configuration: Leverage data sources for dynamic configurations where the values
#    might change outside of Terraform's management, ensuring your configurations remain up-to-date.
# 3. Security: Carefully manage sensitive information fetched through data sources, using outputs
#    and locals wisely to avoid unintended exposure.
# 4. Documentation: Document each data source and its purpose within your module for clarity and
#    maintainability.

# Example Usage of a Data Source:
# The following is an example definition for a hypothetical data source. Replace it with actual
# data sources as per your module's requirements.
#
# data "aws_vpc" "example" {
#   id = var.vpc_id
# }
#
# This data source fetches information about an AWS VPC by its ID, which could then be used
# to configure related resources within the same module.

# 💡 Tip: Use data sources to abstract complexity and dependencies away from your Terraform
# configurations. They can greatly simplify how you manage dependencies on external resources
# and configurations.

# 📚 Additional Resources:
# - Terraform Documentation on Data Sources: https://www.terraform.io/docs/language/data-sources/index.html
# - Provider Documentation: Refer to your provider's documentation for specific data sources available.

# As you expand your module, remember to periodically review your data sources to ensure
# they align with your infrastructure's current state and requirements.
# Happy Terraforming! 🌍🛠️
